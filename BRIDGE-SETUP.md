# MSFS Bridge Setup - Simple & Easy!

## For End Users

### What You Need
- **One file:** `MSFS-Bridge.exe`
- **That's it!** No other files needed.

### How to Use

1. **Download** `MSFS-Bridge.exe`
2. **Run it** - Double-click the file
3. **Paste your Session ID** - Copy it from your dashboard, paste in the dialog
4. **Click Connect** - That's it!

The bridge will:
- Save your Session ID automatically
- Connect to Microsoft Flight Simulator
- Send your flight data to your dashboard
- Remember your Session ID for next time

### Getting Your Session ID

1. Go to your MSFS Maneuver Tracker dashboard (the web app)
2. Sign in to your account
3. On the Dashboard page, you'll see "Your Session ID"
4. Click the "Copy" button
5. Paste it into the bridge dialog

### First Time Setup

When you run the bridge for the first time:
- A dialog window will appear
- It asks for your Session ID
- Paste it and click "Connect"
- The bridge saves it automatically

### Next Time

- Just run the bridge - it remembers your Session ID!
- No dialog needed - connects immediately
- If you want to change accounts, delete `bridge-config.txt` and run again

## Troubleshooting

**"No session ID found"**
- Make sure you copied the full Session ID from your dashboard
- It should look like: `user_638d0af0`

**"Can't connect to MSFS"**
- Make sure Microsoft Flight Simulator is running
- Make sure you're loaded into a flight (in the cockpit)
- Restart MSFS and try again

**"Can't connect to cloud server"**
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure the cloud server is running (contact support if needed)

**Want to change accounts?**
- Delete the `bridge-config.txt` file
- Run the bridge again
- Enter your new Session ID

## That's It!

Super simple - just run one exe, paste your Session ID, and you're connected! 🚀
